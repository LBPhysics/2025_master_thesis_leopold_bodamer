    "# System Description: Atom-Cavity System with External Drives and Baths\n",
    "\n",
    "This document describes a quantum system consisting of a two-level atom interacting with a cavity field, potentially driven by external classical laser fields, and coupled to thermal baths causing dissipation and dephasing. The system parameters are highly configurable, allowing for the study of various regimes and interactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. System Components\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1. Atom\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Energy Levels ($N_{at}$):** The atom can be either absent ($N_{at} = 0$) or a two-level system ($N_{at} = 2$) with a ground state $|g\\rangle$ and an excited state $|e\\rangle$.\n",
    "* **Energy Separation ($\\omega_{at}$):** The energy difference between the excited and ground states is $\\hbar \\omega_{at}$.\n",
    "* **Atomic Operators:**\n",
    "    * $\\sigma_- = |g\\rangle\\langle e|$ and $\\sigma_+ = |e\\rangle\\langle g|$ (lowering & raising operator)\n",
    "    * Pauli matrices: $\\sigma_x = \\sigma_+ + \\sigma_-$, $\\sigma_y = -i (\\sigma_+ - \\sigma_-)$ and $\\sigma_z = |e\\rangle\\langle e| - |g\\rangle\\langle g|$\n",
    "    * $n_{at} = |e\\rangle\\langle e|$ (number operator for the excited state)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2. Cavity\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Number of Levels ($N_{cav}$):** The cavity can be absent ($N_{cav} = 0$) or have a finite even number of energy levels ($N_{cav} > 0$).\n",
    "* **Energy Separation ($\\omega_{cav}$):** The energy difference between consecutive photon number states in the cavity is $\\hbar \\omega_{cav}$.\n",
    "* **Cavity Operators:**\n",

    "## 2. System Hamiltonian\n",
    "\n",
    "The total Hamiltonian of the system can include several parts, depending on the chosen interactions:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1. Free Hamiltonian ($H_0$)\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "H_0 = \\hbar \\omega_{at} \\sigma_+ \\sigma_- + \\hbar \\omega_{cav} a^\\dagger a\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "If either $N_{at} = 0$ or $N_{cav} = 0$, the corresponding term is omitted.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2. Atom-Classical Field Interaction\n",
    "\n",
    "If the atom is driven by a classical laser field with frequency $\\omega_{L,at}$ and coupling strength $g_{at}$, the interaction Hamiltonian is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "H_{at-L} = -\\hbar Rabi_{at} (\\sigma_+ + \\sigma_-) E_{real}(t)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $Rabi_{at} = \\sqrt{g_{at}^2 + \\delta_{at}^2}$ is the Rabi frequency, where $\\delta_{at} = \\omega_{at} - \\omega_{L,at}$ is the detuning and $E_{real}(t) = \\frac{1}{2} (e^{i \\omega_{L,at} t} + e^{-i \\omega_{L,at} t})$ is the real part of the laser field.\n",
    "\n",
    "Under the Rotating Wave Approximation (RWA), this interaction simplifies to:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "H_{at-L}^{RWA} = -\\hbar Rabi_{at} (\\sigma_+ e^{-i \\omega_{L,at} t} + \\sigma_- e^{i \\omega_{L,at} t})\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.3. Cavity-Classical Field Interaction\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, if the cavity is driven by a classical laser field with frequency $\\omega_{L,cav}$ and coupling strength $g_{cav}$, the interaction Hamiltonian is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "H_{cav-L} = -\\hbar Rabi_{cav} (a^\\dagger + a) E_{real}(t)\n",
    "$$\n",

    "### 2.4. Atom-Cavity Interaction\n",
    "\n",
    "The interaction between the atom and the cavity field with coupling strength $g_{at\\_cav}$ is described by the Jaynes-Cummings Hamiltonian:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "H_{at-cav}^{RWA} = \\hbar Rabi_{at\\_cav} (a^\\dagger \\sigma_- + a \\sigma_+ + a^\\dagger \\sigma_+ + a \\sigma_-) = \\hbar g_{at\\_cav} (a^\\dagger + a)(\\sigma_- + \\sigma_+)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "If the Rotating Wave Approximation is applied , the counter-rotating terms are excluded:\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This term describes the exchange of a photon between the cavity and the atom, accompanied by the atom transitioning between its energy levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The code uses $Rabi_{0, at\\_cav} = g_{at\\_cav} \\sqrt{2 n_{photons\\_cav} + 1} / \\hbar$. The detuning is $\\delta_{at\\_cav} = \\omega_{at} - \\omega_{cav}$, and $Rabi_{at\\_cav} = \\sqrt{Rabi_{0, at\\_cav}^2 + \\delta_{at\\_cav}^2}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Dissipation and Dephasing\n",
    "\n",
    "The system is coupled to thermal baths at temperature $T$, leading to energy relaxation and dephasing. The strength of these interactions is characterized by the decay rates $\\gamma_{relax}$ and dephasing rates $\\gamma_{deph}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The thermal occupation number of the baths at frequency $\\omega$ and temperature $T$ is given by the Bose-Einstein distribution:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "n_{th}(\\omega, T) = \\frac{1}{e^{\\hbar \\omega / (k_B T)} - 1}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant and $T$ is the temperature.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.1. Atomic Decay Channels\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Relaxation ($\\gamma_{relax\\_at}$):** The atom can spontaneously decay from the excited state to the ground state, emitting energy into the bath. This is modeled by a Lindblad operator proportional to $\\sigma_-$. Thermal excitation from the ground to the excited state is also included, proportional to $\\sigma_+$.\n",
    "* **Dephasing ($\\gamma_{deph\\_at}$):** Fluctuations in the environment can cause random phase shifts in the atomic superposition states without energy exchange. This is modeled by a Lindblad operator proportional to $\\sigma_+ \\sigma_-$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.2. Cavity Decay Channels\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Relaxation ($\\gamma_{relax\\_cav}$):** Photons can leak out of the cavity into the bath. This is modeled by a Lindblad operator proportional to $a$. Thermal excitation of photons into the cavity from the bath is also included, proportional to $a^\\dagger$.\n",
    "* **Dephasing ($\\gamma_{deph\\_cav}$):** Fluctuations can also cause dephasing of the cavity field, modeled by a Lindblad operator proportional to $a^\\dagger a$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `create_decay_ops_from_strg` function generates the appropriate Lindblad operators (collapse operators, `c_ops_list`) for the master equation or the corresponding system-bath coupling operators (`a_ops_list`) for the bloch redfield eqaution and also for a heom solver that handles baths directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Observables\n",
    "\n",
    "The `e_ops_strg` parameter defines a tuple of strings indicating which expectation values of system operators should be calculated and tracked during the simulation. These include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Pauli matrices: * $\\langle \\sigma_x \\rangle$ (`\"sx\"`), * $\\langle \\sigma_y \\rangle$ (`\"sy\"`), * $\\langle \\sigma_z \\rangle$ (`\"sz\"`)\n",
    "* $\\langle n_{at} \\rangle$ (`\"n_at\"`)\n",
    "* $\\langle n_{cav} \\rangle$ (`\"n_cav\"`)\n",
    "* $\\langle a + a^\\dagger \\rangle$ (`\"a + a.dag()\"`) - related to the cavity field quadrature.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `create_e_ops_from_strg` function translates these strings into the corresponding QuTiP operators.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Rotating Wave Approximation (RWA)\n",
    "\n",
    "The code allows for the application of the Rotating Wave Approximation to the atom-classical field, cavity-classical field, and atom-cavity interactions independently, controlled by the boolean flags `RWA_at`, `RWA_cav`, and `RWA_at_cav`, respectively. The RWA is often used when the driving frequencies are close to the system's resonance frequencies, neglecting rapidly oscillating terms that average to zero over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6. Bath Model Cutoff\n",
    "\n",
    "The `cutoff` parameter defines the cutoff frequency of the bath model used in solvers like BRME and HEOM. \n",
    "\n",
    "## 7. Initial State\n",
    "\n",
    "The initial state of the combined system is determined in the `create_decay_ops_from_strg` function based on the presence of the atom and/or cavity. For example, the atom can be initialized in the excited state (`atom_e`), a superposition state, or the ground state. The cavity can be initialized with a specific number of photons (`basis(N_cav, n)`), a coherent state (`coherent(N_cav, alpha)`), or the vacuum state. If both are present, the initial state is the tensor product of their individual initial states."
