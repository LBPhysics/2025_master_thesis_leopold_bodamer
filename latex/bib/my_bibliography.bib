  abstract = {We develop from first principles Markovian master equations suited for studying the time evolution of a system evolving adiabatically while coupled weakly to a thermal bath. We derive two sets of equations in the adiabatic limit, one using the rotating wave (secular) approximation that results in a master equation in Lindblad form, the other without the rotating wave approximation but not in Lindblad form. The two equations make markedly different predictions depending on whether or not the Lamb shift is included. Our analysis keeps track of the various time and energy scales associated with the various approximations we make, and thus allows for a systematic inclusion of higher order corrections, in particular beyond the adiabatic limit. We use our formalism to study the evolution of an Ising spin chain in a transverse field and coupled to a thermal bosonic bath, for which we identify four distinct evolution phases. While we do not expect this to be a generic feature, in one of these phases dissipation acts to increase the fidelity of the system state relative to the adiabatic ground state.},

First of all, it gives a more satisfactory definition of ρ (see, for example, Sect. 1.1.7), and secondly by using explicitly the algebraic properties of the basis operators the caculations are often greatly simplified (see Sect. 2.5). The usefulness of this method depends on the choice of the basis operator set. When the angular symmetries of the ensemble of interest are important it is convenient to expand ρ in terms of irreducible tensor operators. This method provides a well-developed and efficient way of using the inherent symmetry of the system. It also enables the consequences of angular momentum conservation to be simply allowed for and enables dynamical and geometrical factors in the equation of interest to be separated from each other.},

  abstract = {, X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) of 3d transition metals provides important electronic structure information for many fields. However, X-ray-induced radiation damage under physiological temperature has prevented using this method to study dilute aqueous systems, such as metalloenzymes, as the catalytic reaction proceeds. Here we present a new approach to enable operando XAS of dilute biological samples and demonstrate its feasibility with K-edge XAS spectra from the Mn cluster in photosystem II and the Fe–S centers in photosystem I. This approach combines highly efficient sample delivery strategies and a robust signal normalization method with high-transmission Bragg diffraction-based spectrometers at X-ray free-electron lasers (XFELs) in a damage-free, shot-by-shot mode. These photon-out spectrometers have been optimized for discriminating the metal Mn/Fe Kα fluorescence signals from the overwhelming scattering background present on currently available detectors for XFELs that lack suitable energy discrimination. We quantify the enhanced performance metrics of the spectrometer and discuss its potential applications for acquiring time-resolved XAS spectra of biological samples during their reactions at XFELs.},

Nonlinear optical phenomena are “nonlinear” in the sense that they occur when the response of a material system to an applied optical field depends in a nonlinear manner on the strength of the optical field. In nonlinear optics, the optical response can be described by expressing the polarization as a power series in the field strength. The nonlinear susceptibilities depend on the frequencies of the applied fields. The chapter shows that second-order nonlinear optical interactions can occur only in noncentrosymmetric crystals, that is, in crystals that do not display inversion symmetry, while the third-order nonlinear optical interactions can occur for both centrosymmetric and noncentrosymmetric media. The chapter presents brief qualitative descriptions of a number of nonlinear optical processes. For the processes that can occur in a lossless medium, the chapter indicates how they can be described in terms of the nonlinear contributions to the polarization. The chapter also introduces some notational conventions and the basic concepts of nonlinear optics.},

  abstract = {Two-dimensional (2D) spectroscopy is a powerful technique to study nuclear and electronic correlations between different transitions or initial and final states. Here we describe in detail our development of inherently phase-stabilized 2D Fourier-transform spectroscopy for electronic transitions. A diffractive-optic setup is used to realize heterodyne-detected femtosecond four-wave mixing in a phase-matched box geometry. Wavelength tunability in the visible range is accomplished by means of a 3 kHz repetition-rate laser system and optical parametric amplification. Nonlinear signals are fully characterized by spectral interferometry. Starting from fundamental principles, we discuss the origin of phase stability and the precise calibration of excitation-pulse time delays using movable glass wedges. Automated subtraction of undesired scattering terms removes experimental artifacts. On the theoretical side, the response-function formalism is extended to describe molecules with three electronic levels, and the shape of 2D spectral features is discussed. As an example for this technique, experimental 2D spectra are shown for the dye molecule Nile Blue in acetonitrile at 595 nm, recorded for a series of population times. Simulations explore the influence of different model parameters and qualitatively reproduce the experimental results. We show that correlations between different electronically excited states can be determined from the spectra. The technique described here can be used to measure the third-order response function of complex systems covering several electronic transitions.},

  abstract = {Time-resolved optical spectroscopy is widely used to study vibrational and electronic dynamics by monitoring transient changes in excited state populations on a femtosecond timescale1. Yet the fundamental cause of electronic and vibrational dynamics—the coupling between the different energy levels involved—is usually inferred only indirectly. Two-dimensional femtosecond infrared spectroscopy based on the heterodyne detection of three-pulse photon echoes2,3,4,5,6,7 has recently allowed the direct mapping of vibrational couplings, yielding transient structural information. Here we extend the approach to the visible range3,8 and directly measure electronic couplings in a molecular complex, the Fenna–Matthews–Olson photosynthetic light-harvesting protein9,10. As in all photosynthetic systems, the conversion of light into chemical energy is driven by electronic couplings that ensure the efficient transport of energy from light-capturing antenna pigments to the reaction centre11. We monitor this process as a function of time and frequency and show that excitation energy does not simply cascade stepwise down the energy ladder. We find instead distinct energy transport pathways that depend sensitively on the detailed spatial properties of the delocalized excited-state wavefunctions of the whole pigment–protein complex.},

This tutorial offers a concise and pedagogical introduction to quantum master equations, accessible to a broad, cross-disciplinary audience. The reader is guided through the basics of quantum dynamics with hands-on examples that increase in complexity. The tutorial covers essential methods such as the use of the Lindblad master equation, Redfield relaxation, and Floquet theory, as well as techniques such as Suzuki-Trotter expansion and numerical approaches for sparse solvers. These methods are illustrated with code snippets implemented in  and other languages, which can be used as a starting point for generalization and more sophisticated implementations.

  abstract = {Photosynthesis is a highly optimized process from which valuable lessons can be learned about the operating principles in nature. Its primary steps involve energy transport operating near theoretical quantum limits in efficiency. Recently, extensive research was motivated by the hypothesis that nature used quantum coherences to direct energy transfer. This body of work, a cornerstone for the field of quantum biology, rests on the interpretation of small-amplitude oscillations in two-dimensional electronic spectra of photosynthetic complexes. This Review discusses recent work reexamining these claims and demonstrates that interexciton coherences are too short lived to have any functional significance in photosynthetic energy transfer. Instead, the observed long-lived coherences originate from impulsively excited vibrations, generally observed in femtosecond spectroscopy. These efforts, collectively, lead to a more detailed understanding of the quantum aspects of dissipation. Nature, rather than trying to avoid dissipation, exploits it via engineering of exciton-bath interaction to create efficient energy flow.},

  abstract = {Open quantum systems weakly coupled to the environment are modeled by completely positive, trace preserving semigroups of linear maps. The generators of such evolutions are called Lindbladians. In the setting of quantum many-body systems on a lattice it is natural to consider Lindbladians that decompose into a sum of local interactions with decreasing strength with respect to the size of their support. For both practical and theoretical reasons, it is crucial to estimate the impact that perturbations in the generating Lindbladian, arising as noise or errors, can have on the evolution. These local perturbations are potentially unbounded, but constrained to respect the underlying lattice structure. We show that even for polynomially decaying errors in the Lindbladian, local observables and correlation functions are stable if the unperturbed Lindbladian has a unique fixed point and a mixing time that scales logarithmically with the system size. The proof relies on Lieb–Robinson bounds, which describe a finite group velocity for propagation of information in local systems. As a main example, we prove that classical Glauber dynamics is stable under local perturbations, including perturbations in the transition rates, which may not preserve detailed balance.},

  abstract = {Two-dimensional (2D) correlation spectroscopy is a well-established method for analysis of perturbation-induced spectral changes in various kinds of data. Due to selective correlation of the peaks and resolution enhancement, it provides useful information on the dynamics of spectral changes and enables more reliable band assignments. The generalized 2D correlation approach permits to apply various kinds of perturbations and makes possible for correlation between data obtained from different experiments (hetero-correlation). At the beginning of this chapter are shown the basic principles of 2D correlation spectroscopy together with the rules for interpretation of the synchronous and asynchronous spectra. Next, we report new developments in~this method like sample–sample correlation spectroscopy and perturbation–correlation moving-window 2D correlation spectroscopy. Finally, are shown selected examples of successful applications of 2D correlation spectroscopy for study of interactions and molecular structure.},

Using the dynamics of an exactly-solvable three-level open system as a reference, we show that our approach performs better during the transient evolution, if compared to other approaches like the partial secular master equation or the universal Lindblad equation. To make the comparison between different regularization schemes independent from the initial state, we introduce a new quantitative approach based on the Choi-Jamiołkowski isomorphism.},

We found that electronic dephasing occurs within ∼60 fs and inhomogeneous broadening is approximately 120 cm–1. A three-dimensional global fit analysis allows us to identify several time scales in the dynamics of the 2D spectra ranging from 100 fs to ∼10 ps and to uncover the energy-transfer pathways in LHCII. In particular, the energy transfer between the chlorophyll b and chlorophyll a pools occurs within ∼1.1 ps. Retrieved 2D decay-associated spectra also uncover the spectral positions of corresponding diagonal peaks in the 2D spectra. Residuals in the decay traces exhibit periodic modulations with different oscillation periods. However, only one of them can be associated with the excitonic cross-peaks in the 2D spectrum, while the remaining ones are presumably of vibrational origin. For the interpretation of the spectroscopic data, we have applied a refined exciton model for LHCII. It reproduces the linear absorption, circular dichroism, and 2D spectra at different waiting times. Several components of the energy transport are revealed from theoretical simulations that agree well with the experimental observations.},

Experimentally measuring equilibrium dynamics is a challenging problem that is at the forefront of chemical research. This review describes ultrafast 2D IR vibrational echo chemical exchange experiments and applies them to several types of molecular systems. The formation and dissociation of organic solute-solvent complexes are directly observed. The dissociation times of 13 complexes, ranging from 4 ps to 140 ps, are shown to obey a relationship that depends on the complex’s formation enthalpy. The rate of rotational gauche-trans isomerization around a carbon-carbon single bond is determined for a substituted ethane at room temperature in a low viscosity solvent. The results are used to obtain an approximate isomerization rate for ethane. Finally, the time dependence of a well-defined single structural transformation of a protein is measured.},

How these spectroscopic signatures evolve in time reveals the system dynamics and provides a detailed picture of coherent and incoherent processes. 2DES is rapidly maturing and has already found numerous applications, including studies of photosynthetic energy transfer and photochemical reactions and many-body interactions in nanostructured materials. Many systems of interest contain electronic transitions spanning the ultraviolet to the near infrared and beyond. Most 2DES measurements to date have explored a relatively small frequency range.

The method is limited to weak laser fields (it is thus valid within the third-order perturbation theory) but allows for any pulse durations and automatically accounts for pulse-overlap effects. To illustrate the method, we present the explicit derivation of the three-pulse photon-echo signal. Any other third-order optical signal can be calculated in the same manner. As an example, two- and three-pulse photon-echo and transient-grating signals for a weakly damped displaced harmonic oscillator have been calculated.},

  abstract = {The properties of molecular aggregates, coupled clusters of small molecules, are often challenging to unravel because of their inherent complexity and disordered environments. Their structure−function relationships are often far from obvious. However, their ability to efficiently channel excitation energy over remarkable distances, as is the case in photosynthetic light harvesting, is a compelling motivation to investigate them. Understanding and subsequently mimicking the processes in photosynthesis, for example, will set the stage for considerable advances in using light harvesting to fuel renewable energy technologies. Two-dimensional (2D) electronic spectroscopy is emerging as a nonlinear optical technique that provides significant insight into the interactions and dynamics of complex molecular systems. In addition to spectrally resolving excitation and emission energies over significant bandwidths with femtosecond resolution, this technique has already enabled discoveries about the structure and dynamics of photosynthetic light-harvesting complexes and other aggregates. Multiple capabilities unique to 2D electronic spectroscopy enable such findings. For example, the spectral resolution of excitation and emission combined with the ability to eliminate the effects of static disorder can reveal the homogeneous line width of a transition and the different dynamic contributions to it. Two dimensional spectroscopy is also sensitive to electronic coherence and has been employed to identify and characterize coherent excitation energy transfer dynamics in photosynthetic systems and conjugated polymers. The presence of cross-peaks, signals for which excitation and emission occur at different wavelengths, provides multiple forms of information. First, it allows the identification of states in congested spectra and reveals correlations between them. Second, we can track excitation energy flow from origin to terminus through multiple channels simultaneously. Finally, 2D electronic spectroscopy is uniquely sensitive to intermolecular electronic coupling through the sign and amplitude of the cross-peaks. This feature makes it possible to reveal spatial molecular configurations by probing electronic transitions. Another means of “resolving” these angstrom-scale arrangements is to manipulate the probing laser pulse polarizations. In this way, we can isolate and modulate specific processes in order to retrieve structural information. In this Account, we demonstrate these capabilities through a close collaboration between experiments and modeling on isolated photosynthetic pigment−protein complexes and also on J-aggregates. Each of the probed systems we describe offers insights that have both increased the utility of 2D electronic spectroscopy and led to discoveries about the molecular aggregates’ dynamics and underlying structure.},

  abstract = {Vibrational coherences in ultrafast pump–probe (PP) and 2D electronic spectroscopy (2DES) provide insights into the excited state dynamics of molecules. Femtosecond coherence spectra and 2D beat maps yield information about displacements of excited state surfaces for key vibrational modes. Half-broadband 2DES uses a PP configuration with a white light continuum probe to extend the detection range and resolve vibrational coherences in the excited state absorption (ESA). However, the interpretation of these spectra is difficult as they are strongly dependent on the spectrum of the pump laser and the relative displacement of the excited states along the vibrational coordinates. We demonstrate the impact of these convoluting factors for a model based upon cresyl violet. A careful consideration of the position of the pump spectrum can be a powerful tool in resolving the ESA coherences to gain insights into excited state displacements. This paper also highlights the need for caution in considering the spectral window of the pulse when interpreting these spectra.},

This powerful and versatile time-resolved nonlinear optical spectroscopy technique enables the investigation of individual localized single photon emitters, as well as microscopy of extended samples, e.g., two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides. Starting with the fundamental theory of optically driven two-level systems, we motivate the utility of wave mixing spectroscopy via a discussion on homogeneous and inhomogeneous linewidths which can be independently measured using FWM. We then provide a detailed overview of the heterodyne wave mixing setup operated by one of the authors (JK) at Institut N\textbackslash 'eel in Grenoble, supported by theoretical modeling of the signal detection process. Throughout the paper we elaborate on important benefits of heterodyne wave mixing spectroscopy, e.g., background-free detection, measurement of the full signal field including amplitude and phase, and investigation of coupling mechanisms in few-level systems. Within the context of the latter point we discuss the significance of two-dimensional (2D) FWM spectra. This tutorial is dedicated to students, young researchers, as well as experts in the field of nonlinear spectroscopy in general and FWM in particular. It explains the fundamental concepts and building blocks required to operate a heterodyne wave mixing experiment both from the experimental and theoretical side. This joint approach is helpful for theoreticians who want to accurately and quantitatively model wave mixing signals, as well as for experimentalists who aim to interpret their recorded data.},

  abstract = {Two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy (2D-ES) has become an important technique for studying energy transfer, electronic coupling, and electronic–vibrational coherence in the past ten years. However, since 2D-ES is not interface specific, the electronic information at surfaces and interfaces could not be demonstrated clearly. Two-dimensional electronic sum-frequency generation (2D-ESFG) is an emerging spectroscopic technique that explores the correlations between different interfacial electronic transitions and is the extension of 2D-ES to surface and interfacial specificity. In this work, we present the detailed development and implementation of phase-cycling 2D-ESFG spectroscopy using an acousto-optic pulse shaper in a pump–probe geometry. With the pulse pair generated by a pulse shaper rather than optical devices based on birefringence or interference, this 2D-ESFG setup enables rapid scanning, phase cycling, and the separation of rephasing and nonrephasing signals. In addition, by collecting data in a rotating frame, we greatly improve experimental efficiency. We demonstrate the method for azo-derivative molecules at the air/water interface. This method could be readily extended to different interfaces and surfaces. The unique phase-cycling 2D-ESFG technique enables one to quantify the energy transfer, charge transfer, electronic coupling, and many other electronic properties and dynamics at surfaces and interfaces with precision and relative ease of use. Our goal in this article is to present the fine details of the fourth-order nonlinear optical technique in a manner that is comprehensive, succinct, and approachable such that other researchers can implement, improve, and adapt it to probe unique and innovative problems to advance the field.},

We investigate the collective radiation properties of the singly-excited symmetric state under this 2D RDDI. This state also allows subradiant decays in much longer distances than the transition wavelength, showing longrange atom-atom correlations. We further study the dynamics of the subradiant states which can be accessed by imprinting spatially dependent phases on the atomic arrays. Our results demonstrate rich opportunities in engineering light-matter interactions in a confined 2D reservoir, and hold promise in applications of quantum light storage and single-excitation state manipulations.},

  abstract = {A theoretical analysis is carried out for the recently developed three-pulse photon echo spectroscopy employing dual frequency combs (DFC) as the light sources. In this method, the molecular sample interacts with three pulse trains derived from the DFC and the generated third-order signal is displayed as a two-dimensional (2D) spectrum that depends on the waiting time introduced by employing asynchronous optical sampling method. Through the analysis of the heterodyne-detected signal interferogram using a local oscillator derived from one of the optical frequency combs, we show that the 2D spectrum closely matches the spectrum expected from a conventional approach with four pulses derived from a single femtosecond laser pulse and the waiting time between the second and third field-matter interactions is given by the down-converted detection time of the interferogram. The theoretical result is applied to a two-level model system with solvation effect described by solvatochromic spectral density. The model 2D spectrum reproduces spectral features such as the loss of frequency correlation, dephasing, and spectral shift as a function of the population time. We anticipate that the present theory will be the general framework for quantitative descriptions of DFC-based nonlinear optical spectroscopy.},

  abstract = {▪ Abstract The simplest two-dimensional (2D) spectra show how excitation with one (variable) frequency affects the spectrum at all other frequencies, thus revealing the molecular connections between transitions. Femtosecond 2D Fourier transform (2D FT) spectra are more flexible and share some of the remarkable properties of their conceptual parent, 2D FT nuclear magnetic resonance. When 2D FT spectra are experimentally separated into real absorptive and imaginary refractive parts, the time resolution and frequency resolution can both reach the uncertainty limit set for each resonance by the sample itself. Coherent four-level contributions to the signal provide new molecular phase information, such as relative signs of transition dipoles. The nonlinear response can be picked apart by selecting a single coherence pathway (e.g., specifying the relative signs of energy level difference frequencies during different time intervals as in the photon echo). Because molecules are frozen on the femtosecond timescale, femtosecond 2D FT experiments can separate a distribution of instantaneous molecular environments and intramolecular geometries as inhomogeneous broadening. This review provides an introduction to two-dimensional Fourier transform experiments exploiting second- and third-order vibrational and electronic nonlinearities.},

The crystalline order in a microtubule, with lattice constants short enough to allow energy transfer between amino acid chromophores, is similar to synthetic structures designed for light harvesting. After photoexcitation, can these amino acid chromophores transfer excitation energy along the microtubule like a natural or artificial light-harvesting system? Here, we use tryptophan autofluorescence lifetimes to probe energy hopping between aromatic residues in tubulin and microtubules. By studying how the quencher concentration alters tryptophan autofluorescence lifetimes, we demonstrate that electronic energy can diffuse over 6.6 nm in microtubules. We discover that while diffusion lengths are influenced by tubulin polymerization state (free tubulin versus tubulin in the microtubule lattice), they are not significantly altered by the average number of protofilaments (13 versus 14). We also demonstrate that the presence of the anesthetics etomidate and isoflurane reduce exciton diffusion. Energy transport as explained by conventional Förster theory (accommodating for interactions between tryptophan and tyrosine residues) does not sufficiently explain our observations. Our studies indicate that microtubules are, unexpectedly, effective light harvesters.},

  abstract = {Two-dimensional infrared (2D IR) spectroscopy of the symmetric and asymmetric C≡O stretching vibrations of Rh(CO)2acac in hexane has been used to investigate vibrational coherence transfer, dephasing, and population relaxation in a multilevel vibrational system. The transfer of coherence between close-lying vibrational frequencies results in extra relaxation-induced peaks in the 2D IR spectrum, whose amplitude depends on the coherence transfer rate. Coherence transfer arises from the mutual interaction of the bright CO stretches with dark states, which in this case reflects the mutual d-π* back bonding of the Rh center to both the terminal carbonyls and the acetylacenonate ligand. For 2D IR relaxation experiments with variable waiting times, coherent dynamics lead to the modulation of peak amplitudes, while incoherent population relaxation and exchange results in the growth of the relaxation-induced peaks. We have modeled the data by propagating the density matrix with the Redfield equation, incorporating all vibrational relaxation processes during all three experimental time periods and including excitation reorientation effects arising from relaxation. Coherence and population transfer time scales from the symmetric to the asymmetric stretch were found to be 350 fs and 3 ps, respectively. We also discuss a diagrammatic approach to incorporating all vibrational relaxation processes into the nonlinear response function, and show how coherence transfer influences the analysis of structural variables from 2D IR spectroscopy.},

When the number of atoms tends to infinity, this model can undergo a transition to a superradiant phase, belonging to the mean-field Ising universality class. The superradiant transition was first predicted for atoms in thermal equilibrium and was recently realized with a quantum simulator made of atoms in an optical cavity, subject to both dissipation and driving. In this Progress Report, we offer an introduction to some theoretical concepts relevant to the Dicke model, reviewing the critical properties of the superradiant phase transition, and the distinction between equilibrium and nonequilibrium conditions. In addition, we explain the fundamental difference between the superradiant phase transition and the more common lasing transition. Our report mostly focuses on the steady states of atoms in single-mode optical cavities, but we also mention some aspects of real-time dynamics, as well as other quantum simulators, including superconducting qubits, trapped ions, and using spin-orbit coupling for cold atoms. These realizations differ in regard to whether they describe equilibrium or non-equilibrium systems.},

The interface of this approach with the Ehrenfest scheme for molecular dynamics enables the inclusion of vibronic effects in the calculations based on a classical treatment of the nuclei. The computational complexity of the simulations is reduced by the application of numerical advances such as branching techniques, undersampling, and a novel reduced phase cycling scheme, applicable for systems with inversion symmetry. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method by applying it to prototypical molecules such as benzene, pyridine, and pyrene. We discuss the role of the approximations that inevitably enter the adopted theoretical framework and set the stage for further extensions of the proposed method to more realistic systems.},

  abstract = {QuTiP, the Quantum Toolbox in Python, has been at the forefront of open-source quantum software for the last ten years. It is used as a research, teaching, and industrial tool, and has been downloaded millions of times by users around the world. Here we introduce the latest developments in QuTiP v5, which are set to have a large impact on the future of QuTiP and enable it to be a modern, continuously developed and popular tool for another decade and more. We summarize the code design and fundamental data layer changes as well as efficiency improvements, new solvers, applications to quantum circuits with QuTiP-QIP, and new quantum control tools with QuTiP-QOC. Additional flexibility in the data layer underlying all "quantum objects" in QuTiP allows us to harness the power of state-of-the-art data formats and packages like JAX, CuPy, and more. We explain these new features with a series of both well-known and new examples. The code for these examples is available in a static form on GitHub and will be available also in a continuously updated and documented notebook form in the qutip-tutorials package.},

  abstract = {During the past two decades, two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy (2DES) and related techniques have emerged as a potent experimental toolset to study the ultrafast elementary steps of photosynthesis. Apart from the highly engaging albeit controversial analysis of the role of quantum coherences in the photosynthetic processes, 2DES has been applied to resolve the dynamics and pathways of energy and electron transport in various light-harvesting antenna systems and reaction centres, providing unsurpassed level of detail. In this paper we discuss the main technical approaches and their applicability for solving specific problems in photosynthesis. We then recount applications of 2DES to study the exciton dynamics in plant and photosynthetic light-harvesting complexes, especially light-harvesting complex II (LHCII) and the fucoxanthin-chlorophyll proteins of diatoms, with emphasis on the types of unique information about such systems that 2DES is capable to deliver.

  abstract = {The Jaynes-Cummings (JC) model has been at the forefront of quantum optics for almost six decades to date, providing one of the simplest yet intricately nonlinear formulations of light-matter interaction in modern physics. Laying most of the emphasis on the omnipresence of the model across a range of disciplines, this monograph brings up the fundamental generality of its formalism, looking at a wide gamut of applications in specific physical systems among several realms, including atomic physics, quantum optics, solid-state physics and quantum information science. When bringing the various pieces together to assemble our narrative, we have primarily targeted researchers in quantum physics and quantum optics. The monograph also comprises an accessible introduction for graduate students engaged with non-equilibrium quantum phase transitions, quantum computing and simulation, and quantum many-body physics. In that framework, we aim to reveal the common ground between physics and applications scattered across literature and different technological advancements. The exposition guides the reader through a vibrant field interlacing quantum optics and condensed-matter physics. All sections are devoted to the strong interconnection between theory and experiment, historically linked to the development of the various modern research directions stemming from JC physics. This is accompanied by a comprehensive list of references to the key publications that have shaped its evolution since the early 1960s. Finally, we have endeavored to keep the presentation of such a multi-sided material as concise as possible, interspersing continuous text with various illustrations alongside an economical use of mathematical expressions.},

  abstract = {Photosynthesis is generally assumed to be initiated by a single photon1-3 from the Sun, which, as a weak light source, delivers at most a few tens of photons per nanometre squared per second within a chlorophyll absorption band1. Yet much experimental and theoretical work over the past 40 years has explored the events during photosynthesis subsequent to absorption of light from intense, ultrashort laser pulses2-15. Here, we use single photons to excite under ambient conditions the light-harvesting 2 (LH2) complex of the purple bacterium Rhodobacter sphaeroides, comprising B800 and B850 rings that contain 9 and 18 bacteriochlorophyll molecules, respectively. Excitation of the B800 ring leads to electronic energy transfer to the B850 ring in approximately 0.7 ps, followed by rapid B850-to-B850 energy transfer on an approximately 100-fs timescale and light emission at 850-875 nm (refs. 16-19). Using a heralded single-photon source20,21 along with coincidence counting, we establish time correlation\&nbsp;functions for B800 excitation and B850 fluorescence emission and demonstrate that both events involve single photons. We also find that the probability distribution of the number of heralds per detected fluorescence photon supports the view that a single photon can upon absorption drive the subsequent energy transfer and fluorescence emission and hence, by extension, the primary charge separation of photosynthesis. An analytical stochastic model and a Monte Carlo numerical model capture the data, further confirming that absorption of single photons is correlated with emission of single photons in a natural light-harvesting complex.},

  abstract = {Response theory has a successful history of connecting experimental observations with theoretical predictions. Of particular interest is the optical response of matter, from which spectroscopy experiments can be modelled. However, the calculation of response properties for quantum systems is often prohibitively expensive, especially for nonlinear spectroscopy, as it requires access to either the time evolution of the system or to excited states. In this work, we introduce a generalized quantum phase estimation framework designed for multi-variate phase estimation. This allows the treatment of general correlation functions enabling the recovery of response properties of arbitrary orders. The generalized quantum phase estimation circuit has an intuitive construction that is linked with a physical process of interest, and can directly sample frequencies from the distribution that would be obtained experimentally. In addition, we provide a single-ancilla modification of the new framework for early fault-tolerant quantum computers. Overall, our framework enables the efficient simulation of spectroscopy experiments beyond the linear regime, such as Raman spectroscopy, having that the circuit cost grows linearly with respect to the order of the target nonlinear response. This opens up an exciting new field of applications for quantum computers with potential technological impact.},

The system-field interaction is treated nonperturbatively in the semiclassical dipole approximation, enabling a calculation of third order nonlinear spectroscopic signals directly from molecular dynamics and an efficient modeling of multilevel systems exhibiting relaxation and transfer phenomena. The method, coupled with the treatment of dynamics within the Bloch model, is illustrated by calculations of the two-dimensional three-pulse photon echo spectra of a simple model system—a two-electronic-level molecule. The nonperturbative calculations reproduce well-known results obtained by perturbative methods. Technical limitations of the nonperturbative approach in dealing with a dynamic inhomogeneity are discussed, and possible solutions are suggested.

  abstract = {Controlling transport in quantum systems holds the key to many promising quantum technologies. Here we review the power of symmetry as a resource to manipulate quantum transport, and apply these ideas to engineer novel quantum devices. Using tools from open quantum systems and large deviation theory, we show that symmetry-mediated control of transport is enabled by a pair of twin dynamic phase transitions in current statistics, accompanied by a coexistence of different transport channels. By playing with the symmetry decomposition of the initial state, one can modulate the importance of the different transport channels and hence control the flowing current. Motivated by the problem of energy harvesting we illustrate these ideas in open quantum networks, an analysis which leads to the design of a symmetry-controlled quantum thermal switch. We review an experimental setup recently proposed for symmetry-mediated quantum control in the lab based on a linear array of atom-doped optical cavities, and the possibility of using transport as a probe to uncover hidden symmetries, as recently demonstrated in molecular junctions, is also discussed. Other symmetry-mediated control mechanisms are also described. Overall, these results demonstrate the importance of symmetry not only as a organizing principle in physics but also as a tool to control quantum systems.},

  abstract = {The standard quantum formalism introduced at the undergraduate level treats measurement as an instantaneous collapse. In reality however, no physical process can occur over a truly infinitesimal time interval. A more subtle investigation of open quantum systems lead to the theory of continuous measurement and quantum trajectories, in which wave function collapse occurs over a finite time scale associated with an interaction. Within this formalism, it becomes possible to ask many new questions that would be trivial or even ill-defined in the context of the more basic measurement model. In this thesis, we investigate both theoretically and experimentally what fundamentally new capabilities arise when an experimental apparatus can resolve the continuous dynamics of a measurement. Theoretically, we show that when one can perform feedback operations on the timescale of the measurement process, the resulting tools provide significantly more control over entanglement generation, and in some settings can generate it optimally. We derive these results using a novel formalism which encompasses most known quantum feedback protocols. Experimentally, we show that continuous measurement allows one to observe the dynamics of a system undergoing simultaneous non-commuting measurements, which provides a reinterpretation of the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. Finally, we combine the theoretical focus on quantum feedback with the experimental capabilities of superconducting circuits to implement a feedback controlled quantum amplifier. The resulting system is capable of adaptive measurement, which we use to perform the first canonical phase measurement.},

  abstract = {This is the first of a series of papers dealing with many-particle systems from a unified, nonperturbative point of view. It contains derivations and discussions of various field-theoretical techniques which will be applied in subsequent papers. In a short introduction the general method of approach is summarized, and its relationship to other field-theoretic problems indicated. In the second section the macroscopic properties of the spectra of many-particle systems are described. Asymptotic evaluations are performed which characterize these macroscopic features in terms of intensive parameters, and the relationship of these parameters to thermodynamics is discussed. The special characteristics of the ground state are shown to follow as a limiting case of the asymptotic evaluations. The third section is devoted to the time-dependent field correlation functions, or Green's functions, which describe the microscopic behavior of a multiparticle system. These functions are defined, and related to intensive macroscopic variables when the energy and number of particles are large. Spectral representations and other properties of various one-particle Green's functions are derived. In the fourth section the treatment of non-equilibrium processes is considered. As a particular example, the electromagnetic properties of a system are expressed in terms of the special two-particle Green's function which describes current correlation. The discussion yields specifically a fluctuation-dissipation theorem, a sum rule for conductivity, and certain dispersion relations. The fifth section deals with the differential equations which determine the Green's functions. The boundary conditions that characterize the Green's function equations are exhibited without reference to adiabatic decoupling. A method for solving the equations approximately, by treating the correlations among successively larger numbers of particles, is considered. The first approximation in this sequence is shown to yield a generalized Hartree-like equation. A related, but rigorous, identity for the single-particle Green's function is then derived. A second approximation, which takes certain two-particle correlations into account, is shown to produce various additional effects: The interaction between particles is altered in a manner characterized by the intensive macroscopic parameters, and the modification and spread of the energy-momentum relation come into play. In the final section compact formal expressions for the Green's functions and other physical quantities are derived. Alternative equations and systematic approximations for the Green's functions are obtained.},

  abstract = {Theodor F¨orster (1910–1974) developed a phenomenological theory of nonradiative resonance energy transfer which proved to be transformative in the fields of chemistry, biochemistry, and biology. This paper explores the experimental and the theoretical antecedents of Fo¨rster’s theory of resonance energy transfer (FRET). Early studies of sensitized fluorescence, fluorescence depolarization, and photosynthesis demonstrated the phenomena of long-range energy transfer. At the same time physicists developed theoretical models which contained common physical mechanisms and parameters: oscillating dipoles as models for the atoms or molecules, dipole-dipole coupling for the interaction, and a distance R0 that is optimal for resonance energy transfer. Early theories predicted R0 that was too large as compared to experiments. Finally, in 1946 F¨orster developed a classical theory and in 1948 he developed a quantum mechanical theory; both theories predicted an inverse sixth power dependence of the rate of energy transfer and a R0 that agreed with experiments. This paper attempts to determine why Fo¨rster succeeded when the other theoreticians failed to develop the correct theory. The putative roles of interdisciplinary education and collaborative research are discussed. Furthermore, I explore the role of science journals and their specific audiences in the popularization of FRET to a broad interdisciplinary community.},

  abstract = {Markovian master equations are a ubiquitous tool in the study of open quantum systems, but deriving them from first principles involves a series of compromises. On the one hand, the Redfield equation is valid for fast environments (whose correlation function decays much faster than the system relaxation time) regardless of the relative strength of the coupling to the system Hamiltonian, but is notoriously non-completely-positive. On the other hand, the Davies equation preserves complete positivity but is valid only in the ultra-weak coupling limit and for systems with a finite level spacing, which makes it incompatible with arbitrarily fast time-dependent driving. Here we show that a recently derived Markovian coarse-grained master equation (CGME), already known to be completely positive, has a much expanded range of applicability compared to the Davies equation, and moreover, is locally generated and can be generalized to accommodate arbitrarily fast driving. This generalization, which we refer to as the time-dependent CGME, is thus suitable for the analysis of fast operations in gate-model quantum computing, such as quantum error correction and dynamical decoupling. Our derivation proceeds directly from the Redfield equation and allows us to place rigorous error bounds on all three equations: Redfield, Davies, and coarse-grained. Our main result is thus a completely positive Markovian master equation that is a controlled approximation to the true evolution for any time-dependence of the system Hamiltonian, and works for systems with arbitrarily small level spacing. We illustrate this with an analysis showing that dynamical decoupling can extend coherence times even in a strictly Markovian setting.},

  abstract = {Much can be learned about molecular aggregates by modeling their fluorescence-type spectra. In this study, we systematically describe the accuracy of various methods for simulating fluorescence-type linear spectra in a dimer system with a complex system–environment interaction, which serves as a model for various molecular aggregates, including most photosynthetic light-harvesting complexes (LHCs). We consider the approximate full cumulant expansion (FCE), complex time-dependent Redfield (ctR), time-independent Redfield, and modified Redfield methods and calculate their accuracy as a function of the site energy gap and coupling, excitonic energy gap, and dipole factor (i.e., type of spectrum). We find that the FCE method is the most accurate method for couplings smaller than 300~cm−1 at 300~K, but this method fails for very strong couplings or low temperatures due to inaccurate modeling of the equilibrium initial state. The ctR method performs well for the calculation of fluorescence and linear anisotropy spectra but poorer for circularly polarized fluorescence spectra or for all spectra when the coupling is strong (∼100cm−1). The Redfield and modified Redfield methods generally perform much more poorly than the ctR and FCE methods—especially for small excitonic energy gaps and strong couplings. We show that accurate modeling of the Stokes shift is crucial and present a version of the ctR method that treats both the Stokes shift and initial state correctly for the parameter ranges in plant LHCs. Apart from the application to LHCs, our results will be useful for the spectral characterization and design of organic molecular aggregates.},

We show that cooling such a system invariably polarizes one of the two baths. A polarized relaxational bath creates an effective asymmetry. This asymmetry can be suppressed by additional dephasing noise. This being less effective, the more dominant low frequencies are in the dephasing noise. A polarized dephasing bath generates a large shift in the coherent oscillation frequency of the two-level system. This frequency shift is little affected by additional relaxational noise nor by the frequency distribution of the dephasing noise itself. As our model reflects a typical situation for superconducting phase qubits, our findings can help optimize cooling protocols for future quantum electronic devices.},

The manner in which the two-dimensional spectra reveal electronic couplings in the aggregate system and the evolution of the spectra in time is studied in detail. Changes in the intensity and shape of the peaks in the two-dimensional relaxation spectra are related to the coherent and dissipative dynamics of the system. It is shown that coherent electronic motion, an electronic analog of a vibrational wave packet, can manifest itself in two-dimensional optical spectra of molecular aggregate systems as a periodic modulation of both the diagonal and off-diagonal peaks.},

The advantage of high peak power pico- and femto-second laser pulses allow us to tune the wavelength of laser beams from UV to infrared region of the electromagnetic spectrum by different harmonic generations. These harmonic generations are described in all aspects and how their efficiency will be affected by other nonlinear processes, those cannot be removed by phase matching condition.

We demonstrate how to use these functions to fit spectral densities exemplarily for cases encountered in the description of photosynthetic light harvesting complexes. Finally, we compare absorption spectra obtained for different fits with exact spectra and show that it is crucial to take properly into account the behavior at small frequencies when fitting a given SD.},

  abstract = {Electronic-vibrational dynamics in molecular systems that interact with an environment involve a large number of degrees of freedom and are therefore often described by means of open quantum system approaches. A popular approach is to include only the electronic degrees of freedom into the system part and to couple these to a non-Markovian bath of harmonic vibrational modes that is characterized by a spectral density. Since this bath represents both intra-molecular and external vibrations, it is important to understand how to construct a spectral density that accounts for intra-molecular vibrational modes that couple further to other modes. Here, we address this problem by explicitly incorporating an intra-molecular vibrational mode together with the electronic degrees of freedom into the system part and using the Fano theory for a resonance coupled to a continuum to derive an “effective” bath spectral density, which describes the contribution of intra-molecular modes. We compare this effective model for the intra-molecular mode with the method of pseudomodes, a widely used approach in simulation of non-Markovian dynamics. We clarify the difference between these two approaches and demonstrate that the respective resulting dynamics and optical spectra can be very different.},

  abstract = {Accessing coherences is key to fully understand and control ultrafast dynamics of complex quantum systems like molecules. Most photochemical processes are mediated by conical intersections (CIs), which generate coherences between electronic states in molecules. We show with accurate calculations performed on gas-phase methyl iodide that CI-induced electronic coherences of spin-orbit-split states persist in atomic iodine after dissociation. Our simulation predicts a maximum magnitude of vibronic coherence in the molecular regime of 0.75\% of the initially photoexcited state population. Upon dissociation, one third of this coherence magnitude is transferred to a long-lived atomic coherence where vibrational decoherence can no longer occur. To trace these dynamics, we propose a table-top experimental approach--heterodyned attosecond four-wave-mixing spectroscopy (Hd-FWM). This technique can temporally resolve small electronic coherence magnitudes and reconstruct the full complex coherence function via phase cycling. Hence, Hd-FWM leads the way to a complete understanding and optimal control of spin-orbit-coupled electronic states in photochemistry.},

The direct investigation of local energy distribution under thermal gradient is made using the quantum master equation, and the mixing properties and the convergence of the Green-Kubo formula are investigated when the number of spin increases. We find that the autocorrelation function in the Green-Kubo formula decays as ∼ t−1.5 to a finite value which vanishes rapidly with the increase of the system size. As a result, the Green-Kubo formula converges to a finite value in the thermodynamic limit. These facts strongly support the realization of Fourier heat law in a quantum system.},

An optical cavity is another optically resonant system where the loss from the cavity determines the resonant optical response of the system. The near resonant combination of an optical Fabry-Pérot cavity with laser cooled and trapped atoms couples two distinct optical resonators via light and has great potential for precision measurements and the creation of versatile quantum optics systems. Here we show how driven magneto-optically trapped atoms in collective strong coupling regime with the cavity leads to lasing at a frequency red detuned from the atomic transition. Lasing is demonstrated experimentally by the observation of a lasing threshold accompanied by polarization and spatial mode purity, and line-narrowing in the outcoupled light. Spontaneous emission into the cavity mode by the driven atoms stimulates lasing action, which is capable of operating as a continuous wave laser in steady state, without a seed laser. The system is modeled theoretically, and qualitative agreement with experimentally observed lasing is seen. Our result opens up a range of new measurement possibilities with this system.},

The goal is to give a language to the student in which to speak about quantum physics in more detail, and to start the student on a path of fluency in this language. On our journey we approach questions such as: -- You already know how to calculate the energy eigenstates of a single particle in a simple one-dimensional potential. How can such calculations be generalized to non-trivial potentials, higher dimensions, and interacting particles? -- You have heard that quantum mechanics describes our everyday world just as well as classical mechanics does, but have you ever seen an example where such behavior is calculated in detail and where the transition from classical to quantum physics is evident? -- How can we describe the internal spin structure of particles? How does this internal structure couple to the particles' motion? -- What are qubits and quantum circuits, and how can they be assembled to simulate a future quantum computer?},

  abstract = {We introduce the basic concepts of two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy (2DES) and a general theoretical framework adopted to calculate, from first principles, the nonlinear response of multi-chromophoric systems in realistic environments. Specifically, we focus on UV-active chromophores representing the building blocks of biological systems, from proteins to nucleic acids, describing our progress in developing computational tools and protocols for accurate simulation of their 2DUV spectra. The roadmap for accurate 2DUV spectroscopy simulations is illustrated starting with benchmarking of the excited-state manifold of the chromophoric units in a vacuum, which can be used for building exciton Hamiltonians for large-scale applications or as a reference for first-principles simulations with reduced computational cost, enabling treatment of minimal (still realistic) multi-chromophoric model systems. By adopting a static approximation that neglects dynamic processes such as spectral diffusion and population transfer, we show how 2DUV is able to characterize the ground-state conformational space of dinucleosides and small peptides comprising dimeric chromophoric units (in their native environment) by tracking inter-chromophoric electronic couplings. Recovering the excited-state coherent vibrational dynamics and population transfers, we observe a remarkable agreement between the predicted 2DUV spectra of the pyrene molecule and the experimental results. These results further led to theoretical studies of the excited-state dynamics in a solvated dinucleoside system, showing that spectroscopic fingerprints of long-lived excited-state minima along the complex photoinduced decay pathways of DNA/RNA model systems can be simulated at a reasonable computational cost. Our results exemplify the impact of accurate simulation of 2DES spectra in revealing complex physicochemical properties of fundamental biological systems and should trigger further theoretical developments as well as new experiments.},

  abstract = {The quantum theory of macroscopic systems is a vast, ever-developing area of science that serves to relate the properties of complex physical objects to those of their constituent particles. Its essential challenge is that of finding the conceptual structures needed for the description of the various states of organization of many-particle quantum systems. In this book, Geoffrey Sewell provides a new approach to the subject, based on a "macrostatistical mechanics," which contrasts sharply with the standard microscopic treatments of many-body problems. Sewell begins by presenting the operator algebraic framework for the theory. He then undertakes a macrostatistical treatment of both equilibrium and nonequilibrium thermodynamics, which yields a major new characterization of a complete set of thermodynamic variables and a nonlinear generalization of the Onsager theory. The remainder of the book focuses on ordered and chaotic structures that arise in some key areas of condensed matter physics. This includes a general derivation of superconductive electrodynamics from the assumptions of off-diagonal long-range order, gauge covariance, and thermodynamic stability, which avoids the enormous complications of the microscopic treatments. Sewell also unveils a theoretical framework for phase transitions far from thermal equilibrium. Throughout, the mathematics is kept clear without sacrificing rigor. Representing a coherent approach to the vast problem of the emergence of macroscopic phenomena from quantum mechanics, this well-written book is addressed to physicists, mathematicians, and other scientists interested in quantum theory, statistical physics, thermodynamics, and general questions of order and chaos.},

  abstract = {An open quantum system refers to a system that is further coupled to a bath system consisting of surrounding radiation fields, atoms, molecules, or proteins. The bath system is typically modeled by an infinite number of harmonic oscillators. This system-bath model can describe the time-irreversible dynamics through which the system evolves toward a thermal equilibrium state at finite temperature. In nuclear magnetic resonance and atomic spectroscopy, dynamics can be studied easily by using simple quantum master equations under the assumption that the system-bath interaction is weak (perturbative approximation) and the bath fluctuations are very fast (Markovian approximation). However, such approximations cannot be applied in chemical physics and biochemical physics problems, where environmental materials are complex and strongly coupled with environments. The hierarchical equations of motion (HEOM) can describe the numerically "exact" dynamics of a reduced system under nonperturbative and non-Markovian system-bath interactions, which has been verified on the basis of exact analytical solutions (non-Markovian tests) with any desired numerical accuracy. The HEOM theory has been used to treat systems of practical interest, in particular, to account for various linear and nonlinear spectra in molecular and solid state materials, to evaluate charge and exciton transfer rates in biological systems, to simulate resonant tunneling and quantum ratchet processes in nanodevices, and to explore quantum entanglement states in quantum information theories. This article presents an overview of the HEOM theory, focusing on its theoretical background and applications, to help further the development of the study of open quantum dynamics.},

Here we present a variation of two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy that is capable of mapping spatially varying differences in excitonic structure, with sensitivity orders of magnitude better than conventional spatially-averaged electronic spectroscopies. The approach performs fluorescence-detection-based fully collinear two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy in a microscope, combining femtosecond time-resolution, sub-micron spatial resolution, and the sensitivity of fluorescence detection. We demonstrate the approach on a mixture of photosynthetic bacteria that are known to exhibit variations in electronic structure with growth conditions. Spatial variations in the constitution of mixed bacterial colonies manifests as spatially varying peak intensities in the measured two-dimensional contour maps, which exhibit distinct diagonal and cross-peaks that reflect differences in the excitonic structure of the bacterial proteins., 2D electronic spectroscopy enables a spatially-averaged view of the electronic structure of a heterogeneous system. Here, the authors extend it to sub-micron resolution and \textasciitilde 106 times better sensitivity, to resolve spatially varying excitonic structure in a heterogeneous mixture of photosynthetic cells.},

  abstract = {A general nonperturbative approach to the calculation of femtosecond pump-probe spectra of dissipative systems is outlined. The intramolecular couplings as well as the field-matter interactions are treated in an exact manner, while the interaction with a thermal environment is treated approximately in the framework of the Redfield theory. The inherent problem of a nonperturbative treatment of the external field, that is, the discrimination of individual spectroscopic processes, is solved by extending the method of Seidner et al. (J. Chem. Phys. 103 (1995) 3998) to a denskity-matrix description. As a first application and illustration of the proposed method, we investigate electron-transfer processes including environmental effects. Considering various pump-probe spectra as well as coherent photon-echo signals which are resolved in time, frequency and direction of emission, we discuss the interplay of electron-transfer dynamics and damping of the vibrational motion as well as the detection of these processes by femtosecond pump-probe spectroscopy.},
